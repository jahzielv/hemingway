# Contributing to Hemingway
Contributions are very welcome! If you use Hemingway and want to improve it, or if you are good at Rust and see places where the code could be improved,
please send contributions of all types.

## Stuff to consider
- I'm using Hemingway as a way to learn Rust, and that's my main objective with this project.
- If you can't/don't want to contribute code, I'd still love ideas! Feel free to open an issue (and use the correct labels) to let me know your thoughts.
- Since I'm learning, there will probably be bad code/bad patterns. Please let me know if this is the case, and I'd love PRs that helpfully state issues in the code!
- My main priority with Hemingway's functionality is simplicity. I want the program to be as bare-bones and fast as possible. That doesn't mean I don't want new and cool features! That just means that I have to choose between Hemingway doing something or it not doing something, I'm probably going to choose not.

## Rules and such
For right now, I'll approve all changes to Hemingway and merge them into `main`.
